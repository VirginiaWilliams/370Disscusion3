To this point, I think the specific topic that I've found most interesting has been the topic of having a security mindset. I think, more so than any of the technical topics, this topic seems to be the most important to the types of work I'll be doing in my career. I've discovered that I really enjoy building web-based applications and would like to focus on that area specifically in my career. Prior to this class, I knew cybersecurity was important to that specific focus, but I didn't exactly realize just how central to the discipline it really was. You can't build a useful web application without first making it secure. This realization really dawned on me upon reading the article "The Security Mindset" by Bruce Schneier. I found it interesting just how ubiquitous security systems really are. Nearly everything in our world has some sort of security system. The reason for this is because, whatever can be hacked, will be hacked for various reasons. The only way to combat this is to adopt a security mindset and to look for ways to make systems more secure. Since reading that initial article by Schneier, I've very much enjoyed reading other articles by Schneier on his blog. By way of example, it's interesting to note the vast breadth of topics he covers simply by applying a security mindset in everything he thinks about. He covers topics, like Ransomware attacks using Bitcoin, government attempts to use artificial intelligence, and even the widespread use of Peloton bikes and their security threat. Given the many different topics Schneier's insight is able to cover, I think the topic of security mindset has to be my favorite thus far.
